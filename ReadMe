This project is to analyze different architecure of DNN for different datasets of ECG. 

Pytorch is used to train and evaluate 

The test code is added to each model. Just loading the model did not work as it was expecting a architecture defined before.

The label structure is N,V,A

TODO:
Have to do transfer learning for the final 3 layers.
